# idea-tostring-textblock-template
Template for toString() generation for IntelliJ Idea using java multiline string available since JDK 15.

Double hashtag (##) are used to mark subsequent code as comment, so when you see them at the end of a line is because the engine
automatically inserts a new line always even if you dont want to, so marking as comment at the end of the line
makes it ignore the new line.

If you need further help with syntax IntelliJ Idea uses Apache Velocity Template Engine to generate this template,
so please consult it's documentation.
